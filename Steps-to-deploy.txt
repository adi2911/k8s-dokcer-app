To replace Travis with Github Actions you can do the following:

Before beginning, make sure you have followed the two notes to create a Google Cloud Project, and GKE cluster here:

https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25406546#questions/17305086

Then, make sure you have created a Service Account and have downloaded the JSON key:

https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/learn/lecture/25408376#questions/17305086

1. Delete your .travis.yml file from the local project. Optionally, you may also delete the deploy.sh file as this will be written directly into our workflow.

2. Navigate to your Github repository.

3. Click Settings

4. Click Secrets

5. Click Actions

6. Click New repository secret

7. Create key/value pair secrets for DOCKER_USERNAME, DOCKER_PASSWORD

8. Create a GKE_SA_KEY secret key. Paste the contents of the Service Account JSON downloaded earlier as the value. Important - you will not need to encrypt the service account file locally using a container. This was only needed for use with Travis.

Important - You do not need to create an environment or environment secrets. Doing so will cause a failure of the action without making additional changes to the workflow file.

All that is required is simply creating the repository secrets as shown below:






9. In your local development environment, create a .github directory at the root of your project

10. Create a workflows directory inside the new .github directory

11. In the workflows directory create a deploy.yaml file which should contain the following code (name does not matter):

Important - remember to change your project_id, cluster_name, and location to the values used by your GKE environment and change my DockerHub username and images to your own.
